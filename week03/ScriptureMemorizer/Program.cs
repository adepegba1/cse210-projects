/// <summary>
/// This program displays a list of Bible scriptures.
/// A random scripture is chosen and displayed to the user.
/// The user can keep pressing Enter to gradually hide 3 words at a time,
/// making it a memory exercise to recall the scripture.
/// The user can also type "quit" to end the program at any time.
/// Once all words are hidden, the program ends automatically.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// How it works step by step:
/// 1. A random scripture is picked from the list.
/// 2. The scripture is displayed in the console.
/// 3. The user can press Enter to hide 2 random words.
/// 4. If the user types "quit", the program ends immediately.
/// 5. If all words are hidden, the program tells the user and ends.
/// </remarks>
